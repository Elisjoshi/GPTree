## Agenda For Project Meeting

1. Ensure that everyone has a stable local installation of GPTree, that this process is well documented, and that all users have access to the DB
2. Discuss goals for this week, and assign specific tasks to individuals.
3. Discuss design assignment, and determine which people will be responsible for which parts
4. Discuss UI/UX features, and make sure that UI/UX team is setup on Figma or other tool to begin design process.
5. Meet with TA (Ask questions below)
6. Group work (if time)

## Richman Pham

**i. Last week’s goals**
- Finish the frontend so users can create trees and generate nodes end to end and begin hallway user testing with friends (approximately 3 to 4 hours)
