# Team Report

## i. Last week's goals
  - UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
    - Begin whiteboard process for landing page, tree page, SR learning page, create rough designs/wireframe. Basic design choices must be made such as aesthetic, color pallate, and "vibe" of the app.

    - Primary focus is to define Prisma Schema for key entities, and then write the .prisma schema file.
    - Write REST API endpoints so that client can start making requests to the database relevant to GPTree
    - Work with frontend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment

## ii. Progress and issues
  - UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
    - 
  - Frontend (Richman, Yana, Brittan)

    - User can naviate to tree page from landing page.
  - Backend (Jackson, Jungho, Brittan)
    - Prisma Schema has been defined
    - API endpoint is written that allows for user authentication, connected to Prisma db as adapter
    
## iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
- All Rest Endpoints are defined (4 hrs)
- There is a UI skeleton for a tree on the tree page (4 hrs)
- Users can nagigate between the 3 pages (1 hr)
- There is a left panel that lets users create and view different tree entities (2 hrs)

## Agenda For Project Meeting

1. Ensure that everyone has a stable local installation of GPTree, that this process is well documented, and that all users have access to the DB
2. Discuss goals for this week, and assign specific tasks to individuals.
3. Discuss design assignment, and determine which people will be responsible for which parts
4. Discuss UI/UX features, and make sure that UI/UX team is setup on Figma or other tool to begin design process.
5. Meet with TA (Ask questions below)
6. Group work (if time)

### Questions for TA (Add here whenever needed)

1. n/a (for now)
