Communcication policies within the team have been further specified going forward
Everyone on the team has been able to clone into the GitHub repo
Refined Use Cases and Timeline based on feedback to include much more detail
Issues
There was an issue with the dev environment on MacOS which was caused by a second app directory being generated for Prisma, which has been resolved
There is currently a 500 status code issue with the dev environent that is also related to Prisma, we are unsure of the cause but will look into it this week (See plans in Richman and Jackson's sections)
iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)

We plan on defining our system architecture this week, along with beginining to have the codebase reflect these decisions. We will begin to consider design choices as well.
UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
Begin whiteboard process for landing page, tree page, SR learning page, create rough designs/wireframe. Basic design choices must be made such as aesthetic, color pallate, and "vibe" of the app.
Frontend (Richman, Yana, Brittan)
Define component hierarchy and page layouts.
Work with backend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment
Backend (Jackson, Jungho, Brittan)
Primary focus is to define Prisma Schema for key entities, and then write the .prisma schema file.
Write REST API endpoints so that client can start making requests to the database relevant to GPTree
Work with frontend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment
Agenda For Project Meeting

Ensure that everyone has a stable local installation of GPTree, that this process is well documented, and that all users have access to the DB
Discuss goals for this week, and assign specific tasks to individuals.
Discuss design assignment, and determine which people will be responsible for which parts
Discuss UI/UX features, and make sure that UI/UX team is setup on Figma or other tool to begin design process.
Meet with TA (Ask questions below)
Group work (if time)
Questions for TA (Add here whenever needed)

- Verify Prisma config and DB connectivity (approximately 1.5–2 hrs)
- Inspect server logs/stack traces; add temporary error logging to pinpoint failing route or DB call (1–2 hrs)
- Validate Node/npm versions and reinstall deps; clear cache and rebuild (0.5–1 hr)
- Definition of done: npm run dev starts without 500 errors; one test page performs a successful DB read.
- Fix root cause of the 500

Set up an account with Prisma and Vercel
Issues
(Same as Richman) Unable to run the development server, consistent “500 Internal Server Error”.
Suspected causes: incomplete Prisma setup (missing account/DB connection/config)
Error persists after basic restart attempts; needs targeted debugging (see plans).
